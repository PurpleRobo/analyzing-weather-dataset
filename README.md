### Project Overview

 The project uses a weather data set of 2012 which have various columns like temperature, dewpoint, weather, etc. for evrey hour of year 2012. Here, I've used various data wrangling techniques using pandas library.  I've created various functions that serve various purposes eg. distribution, grouping, aggregation, creating pivot tables, etc. It's just a basic project for the begineers who want to learn pandas.
